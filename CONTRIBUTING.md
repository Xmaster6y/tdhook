# How to Contribute?

## Guidelines

The project dependencies are managed using `uv`, see their installation [guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Additionally, to make your life easier, install `just` to use the shortcut commands.

## Dev Install

Install the dependencies and the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
just install
```

To run the checks (`pre-commit` checks):

```bash
just checks
```

To run the tests (using `pytest`):

```bash
just tests
```

## Branches

Make a branch before making a pull request to `develop`.
